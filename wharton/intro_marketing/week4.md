# Brand messaging & Communication
- Perception: the process of developing an interpretation of a stimulus, or in other words, deciding what a stimulus means
  - Most crucial behavior for two reasons:
    1. What customers perceive is what affects their actions
    2. What is perceived is not necessarily what is "true"
- The process of perception is constructive, its contextual
  - The meanings are constructed as needed and are based upon two major factors:
    - The *actual* stimulus or event
    - Our prior expectations and what we know
