# Brand messaging & Communication
- Perception: the process of developing an interpretation of a stimulus, or in other words, deciding what a stimulus means
  - Most crucial behavior for two reasons:
    1. What customers perceive is what affects their actions
    2. What is perceived is not necessarily what is "true"
- The process of perception is constructive, its contextual
  - The meanings are constructed as needed and are based upon two major factors:
    - The *actual* stimulus or event
    - Our prior expectations and what we know

## Stroop Test

- Makes you feel uncomfortable because of the dissonance
- This is an example of how your perceptions influence your behavior

## Proximity bias
- Things are closer to eachother have to belong to eachother

## Similarity bias
- Things that look similar must be similar (can be thought of in the franchise model, you infer quality on the Subway brand, not the individual chain)

## Brand
- In coco-cola, if you slap that brand on the same drink people perceive it as tasting better, etc.
	- Coca-cola brand is valued at $70B

## Packaging

- 1930's packaging research
	- Grocery stores changed from clerks to choose the brand to customers
	- This made packaging much more important
	- Early experiment - two identical detergents, one with a circle logo, the other with the triangle. People preferred the circle
		- Customers believed the detergent with the circle actually worked better
- Can influence point of purchase
- Can have a continuing influence at point of consumption
- Multiple objectives
	- Identify
	- Present information
	- Protect and allow transportation
	- Store
	- Aid consumption
- Creating impactful packaging
	- Understand that package aesthetics and function are both critical
		- The package should grab the attention
		- But it also has to work again
	- Know the distribution
		- How do retailers view your package
		- How are channels chaning?
		- Which retailers like which package configurations
- Packaging shapes examples
	- Calvin Klein
		- Fragrance that came out with both men and women
		- Shape of the fragrance was in the shape of a flask
	- Absolut
		- They had this print campaign on the bottle shape
	- Coca-cola
		- Bottle shape is very iconic
	- Heinz
		- Ironic because it gets in the way of the product consumption
	- Refrigerator packs were innovative (the rectangular packs that you could remove the front so that the cans all roll out)

## Persuasion

- An active attempt to change belief and attitude
	- Caveat: difficult!
- 

### Elaborations likelihood model

- Two routes of persuasion
	- Systematic (central)
	- Superficial (peripheral)

![](http://imgur.com/elO0BnF.png)

#### Central route to persuasion
- When motivation (involvemnt), opportunity and ability to process marketing messages are high
- Focus mainly on "central cues" in the message

#### Peripheral route to persuasion
- When motivation, opportunity, ability and elaboration likelihood are low
- Focus primarily on "preipheral cues" in the message
- What are peripheral cues?
	- Classical conditioning (pavlovs dog)
	- Reciprocity: you owe me (gift to potential customer)
	- Consistency: we've always done it that way
	- Social proof: everybody's doing it
	- Liking: love me, love my ideas
	- Authority: because I say so, you should
	- Scarcity: quick, before they're all gone

### Celebrity models

- What makes a good celebrity endorser?
	- If you are following the central route, they should be used as an expert
	- If you are going the peripheral route, you should appeal to emotions
	- High Q-rating - marketing metric
- General considerations
	- Celebrity / audience fit
	- Celebrity / brand fit
	- Celebrity attractiveness
	- Practical considerations (cost, celebrity exposure, etc.)
	- Social network
- *Transfer of meaning* model
	- Celebrities have charged, powerful meanings, want to transfer to your brand
	- Advertising firm chooses the celebrity that best represents the appropriate symbolic properties of the product
	- Consumers derive meaning from celebrities and transfer same meaning to product
	- fMRI scans show that there is more brain activation when presented with images of celebrities - a visceral reaction to celebrity
- Source models
	- Sources credibility (effectiveness depends on celeberity's *expertness* and *trustworthiness*
	- Source attractiveness (effectiveness depends on familiarity, likability and/or similarity)
- How are celebrities used in advertisements?
	- Explict mode - *I endorse this product*
	- Implicit mode - *I use the product*
	- Imperative mode - *You should use this product*
	- Co-present mode - celebrity appears with the product

# Repositioning a brand
- A brand has to stay fresh and relevant
- Brand equity must be actively managed over time
	- Harder to fix than to maintain it's relevance
- Sometimes brand meaning must be adjusted
- 5 rationales for brand change:
	1. The identity / execution was poorly conceived
		- Can often be identified by measures of consumer interest
	2. The target for the identity / execution is limited
	3. The identity / execution has become out of date
	4. The identity / execution has lost it's edge, became old-fashioned
	5. The identiy / execution has just become tired
- Most important task to change: consistency, consistency, consistency
	- Potential cognitive inconsistency, people rationalize a cognitive dissonance so they can be internally consistent

Consistency theories: summary
> The basic idea is that there is a drive to maintain consistency within cognitive systems. Thus, cognitive structures may change in order to increase consistency among elements.

- Famous example of poorly chaning brands
	- Oldsmobile --> Dad
	- Oldsmobile comes out with a new ad with excitement
	- Dad's aren't exciting, so this is dissonant
	- Crashed and burned
- Evolving brand associations
	- A brand can evolve more gradually to gain mroe contemporary associations while maintaining familiarity
		- Symbols
		- Brand names
		- Slogans
		- New products
- Can make these little tweaks with just a noticeable difference

![](http://imgur.com/i3TLwBR)

- Other way you can do it is via the "buttefly effect"
	- "I'm deliberately doing this to make the brand fresh"
- Change the brand name to eliminate constraints
	- Boston chicken --> boston market
	- Weather channel --> Weather companies
- Example of evolving brand image
	- BMW had a lot of connotations on it
		- European, expensive, baby boomers, fast, etc
		- Created BMW sunglasses
		- Sponsored golf tournaments
	- Budweiser did this really well

## Evolving trademarks
- Wendy's changed their slogan
	- Changed the type-face
	- Removed the *Old Fashioned Hamburgers*

## Major points
- Consistency over time is very valuable in building strong brands
- All brand elements shoudl work in harmony to communicate brand identity
- Change is sometimes necessary - but be careful
- Begin by understanding sources of equity and the current contributions to POP and POD, strength, favorabiltiy and uniqueness
