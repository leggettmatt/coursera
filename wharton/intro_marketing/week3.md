# Online / Offline Competition
- Why offline is still important
	- 90% of all purchases are still performed offline
	- Why is this?
		- Delivery times
		- Uncertainty of the "fit and feel"
		- Cost of returns (time and money)
- Do brick and mortar shops influence online sales? (ie; does a bookstore moving into a zip code reduce amazon's aggregate sales?)
	- Yes, they do, but only for popular products (like harry potter)
	- This leads to the concept of *The Long Tail*

# Friction
- Search friction
	- 1987 rugby world cup... where do I buy a TV? Which store will have the best price and assortment?
	- When you find the price, you have to make a decision, do you buy this price? Or do you buy it now?
	- In 2013, you can find all the prices quickly.
- Geographic friction
	- NY vs. Iowa City
	- Amount of services in NY is significantly better than in Iowa City

# The Long Tail

![Long Tail Product](http://www.thelongtail.com/conceptual.jpg)

- Books
	- Say there are 5 million books
	- Say harry potter is the highest popularity for book
	- The *head* of the curve is normally brick and mortar and the tail is internet
- Background
	- We lived in a world of **hits** or **blockbusters**
	- Hypotheses
		- The Long Tail exists because the economics of storage and distribution have changed; this is the **supply side**
		- The Long Tail is itself endogenous (**demand side**) as there are more ways for us to discover variety
- Old-New Economics
	- Pareto principle
		- This changes with The Long Tail since the tail can account for a large amount of purchases
- Key Principles
	- The _tyranny of locality_ means that your selection of products is dictated by your local natives
		- As an example, a boutique film is only desired by 1 million people but the concentration of the desired populations is widely dispersed and so you can't show it in any city, even a relatively large city
- The range of quality and satisifaction is significantly greater in the long tail
	- If I randomly select a product from the head, it's likely that I will deem the quality satisfactory. This is not true in the long tail
	- Moving from the head and the tail, the average quality decreases but the heterogeity of customers increases
- Main characteristics of the long tail
	- The ratio of niche products to "hits" is changing
	- Distribution efficiency is amplifying (digital, search, etc.)
	- Recommendations and reviews drive search so that customers get into the tail
	- Collective value of niches > hits
	- Long tail is culture unfiltered by scarcity

### Long tail research
- Researchers wanted to disentangle the supply side from the demand side of the long tail
	- Supply side == larger product availability
	- Demand side == easier product discoverability (a la internet)
- MIT study obtained data from a retailer offering identical product selection and prices through two diffgerent channels - internet and catalog
- Descriptive evidence is that internet sales are significantly less concentrated

**Ginni Coefficient**

> Used to evaluate the equality of incomes or products

```
G = A / (A +B)
```


![Ginni Coefficient](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Economics_Gini_coefficient2.svg/1024px-Economics_Gini_coefficient2.svg.png)

In this diagram, C is the percentile of income (so this person's income is in the 50th percentile) but his income is only ~20% of the cumulative total income received. As the Lorenz curve approaches the line of equality, income is more evenly distributed. You can sub products for individual income and it gives you the same information on equality.

In this research, the Gini coefficient was more equal through the internet than through the catalog, this means there were more long tail sales in the internet section than catalog. In this experiment the supply side was held constant but the demand side is bigger.

When you launch a new product, you can think about the long-tail as also locations. When it's first launch, your sales are concentrated in major metrpolitan areas but as time passes, distribution extends to other locations as well.

### Critiques and Summary
- Law of *natural monopoly* (hits get disproportionate share of light users)
- Law of *double jeopardy* (unfamiliar things are less well liked)

# Preference Isolation
Imagine that you live in a town where everyone wears ties all the time. Then, imagine that you'd like a blue tie, but everyone else wants a red one. Will you get what you want?

Unlikely, since there is a cost associated with producing and holding inventory for a larger inventory. This means that the *preference minority* won't get what they want.

### Diapers.com Research

[Preference minorities and the Internet](https://mackinstitute.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Preference-Minorities-and-the-Internet.pdf)

If you are selling things online, this gives you the ability to aggregate individual minorities together to be a viable market.

> *isolated* prospects are worth pursuing

They went to different stores, took the proportion of households with babies and looked to see how much shelf space was allocated to diapers.

##### Theory

Physical store stocking rules

```
total_shelf_space_per_market = total_market_size * percentage_of_individuals_with_desired_characteristics
```

What this means is that for a lower percentage, the total shell space will be distributed across multiple stores and so product selection will decrease.

##### Research Findings

If they took zip codes that were the 90% percentile isolated compared to the 10% percentile isolated the category sales in 90% was 50% higher. Also, the niche products sold 125% higher.

# How internet retailing startups grow

[What matters most in Internet Retailing](http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/what-matters-most-in-internet-retailing/)

Data used for analysis:
- Sales data from company from inception
- Customer ID, Date, transaction value, zip code
- Geo-demographic "real world" data

All to answer: *Why do some locations have mroe customers than other locations?*

### 5 Principles

Only precented on three principles.

**Principle one** 
> Customer acceptance of online retail depends on offline shopping costs

- internet retailers can alter the cost-benefit trade-off shoppers by making things "closer" and more accessible, perhapes even at better prices.

**Principle two**
> Sales evolution is structured and predictable

-  Social contagion from communication and observation draws in more customers overtime
- Sales seem to propagate next to each other
- Customers could be talking to each other or customers could be observing each other

**Principle three**
> Migrating from "good" to "great' requires expansion to niche locations

- Spatial structure follows a pattern of proximity and similarity (similar to long-tail)
- There are two ways to think about distance
	- Geographic
	- Social, or demographic distance
- In the beginning, sales start out in larger cities and spread by proximity
- Later on, sales pick up in smaller areas that are quite far away in geographic distance but demographics were very similar

# Customer and Digital Marketing
- Customer goals: attract, engage and retain subject to:
	- Never pay more to acquire than you will recoup CLV > AC
	- CLV needs to incorporate RLV or **R**eferral **L**ifetime **V**alue
- Diapers.com did a promotional campaign where people could refer others and gain store credit if the individual successfully closed
	- 8% successfully referred individuals (8,000 out of 100,000)
		- Top referrers recruited 150 customers
- Considerations
	- Monologue to conversation
	- Amplification through virtual and real world synergy
	- "Long tail" leverage
		- Some people are extreme, how do you target them and leverage them?
- Selection effect
	- The ones doing the referrals have a good way to select future customers that have higher CLV
- Marketing "spend" as an asset- (third of three assets, other two being brand and customer)

# Influence and How Information Spreads

##### Overview
- [Controversial Study on Obesity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJfq-o5nZQ4)
- Elements of Networks
- Elements of Neighborhoods
- Four Research Studies on Influence and Contagion
	- Neighborhood (internet retailing)
	- Network (influence among users at a social networking site)
	- Network (prescribing behavior of physicians in Los Angeles)
	- Neighborhood (internet fashion retailing)

### Study on obesity
- Obesity seems to spread like a virus

### Elements of Networks
> Pathways through which information, advice, resources and support folow between people
- (Aral 2012)

- Networks can be physical or virtual
- Networks usually exhibit homphily, either in characteristics or preferences. Similar people tend to cluster together
- A network can be as simple as a dyad, e.g. two partners or so complex as to encompass hundres of thousands of people
	- Nodes (people)
	- Connections (between people)
	- Ability to share information and resources
	- Constraints (geography, socioeconomics)
	- [More info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U-tOghblfE)
- Entering a network is a choice
- We also decide how many people we want to connect to and how central we want to be
- When our relationships are transitive (our friends know each other) we are deeply embedded
- Being affected by a network
	- Random guy looking up at the sky, 4% of people looked up. If there were 15 people looking up 40% of people looked up.
- Six degrees of separation
	- Took a few hundred people from Nebraska and told them to get a letter to a random person in Boston but you can only send the letter to someone you know. It took 6 connections to get there, that's where the 6 degrees of separation came from.
- Three degrees of influence
	- After a message has been sent along the network, the influence of the originating node decays exponentially, and by third connection you have little to no influence

# Pricing Strategies
### Motivation and Puzzles
- Many individuals perform cost-plus pricing which is wrong
- Pricing can provide a huge opportunity to improve operating profit
![Mckinsey pricing study](http://i.imgur.com/Hs7e770.png)
#### Pricing puzzles
- Trader Joe's
	- Sells private products
	- Imagine a set of dumplings cost $3.99
		- Since it's a private label, you can't tell if it's expensive
	- For comparable products, Trader Joe's prices extremely low (like water) so that differentiated products can be priced very expensive
- Walmart
	- Why does walmart price a detergent as $4.73?
		- It shows that they have done **everything possible** to squeeze out profits for you
- Catalog company
	- A-B test where half of the individuals were given the $44 price vs. $49 - more people bought the $49 than the $44

### Four inputs to pricing
1. Marginal cost (the floor)
2. Customer willingness to pay (the ceiling)
	- Can't charge here due to competition
3. Competition is the third factor that reduces ceiling
4. Prices that have to be raised due to redistibutors, etc.

### 5Cs and Pricing
- Customers
	- Price sensitivity (ie; price elasticity)
	- Pychological issues (see below for more details)
		- Odd numbered endings
		- Mental accounting
		- Prospect theory, loss aversion
		- Endowment affect
- Company
	- Financial considerations
		- Target margin or internal rate of return
	- Consistency in the product line
		- Camry vs. accord
	- Consistency in Image
		- Neiman Marcus can't really cut prices due to hit's high value perception
- Collaborators
	- How hard will the collaborator work to "push" your product
- Competitors
	- Competitor aggressiveness (how far will they cut)
	- Willingness to respond on price
		- Direct financial cost to the competitor
	- Competitor position
		- Market leaders are more likely to initiate; followers are more likely to imitate and reduce price
- Context (not discussed)

### Price sensitivity
- Affected by
	- Ease of comparison (if I can easily compare prices, the product is more elastic) 
	- Expenditure size
	- Large volume users tend to be more price sensitive
	- Shared expenses
		- Separation between the buyer and the payers
	- Price / Quality Inferences
		- When quality differences exist between, but the user cannot distinguish them - a higher price signals higher quality
- How to measure
![How to measure](http://i.imgur.com/crPSI56.png)
- Example of an experiment on changing price and seeing associated demand
![Experiment](http://i.imgur.com/CFnP22j.png)
- Conjoint analysis
	- Presented different groups of people with Warby Parker glasses with varied pricing
- Direct survey
	- If you ask people "what are you willing to pay" is dangerous, will be biased to low price
	- Instead, ask "for this product at price x, on a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to buy?" with different values of x
- Pyschological Factors
	- 9 endings usually suggest that it's a discount in western cultures
	- Experiment effect of advertised price endings on sales of butter

| Category | Sales |
| :--- | :--- |
| Regular price ($0.83) |  100% (2817 units) |
| Discount price ($0.63) | 194% |
| Further discounted price ($0.59) | (406%) |

- Note the non-linearity in this change.
