# From Product-Centric to Customer-Centric Management
- See previous section for three marketing strategies (the how of how company's make money)
	- Performance superiority
	- Operational excellence
	- Customer centricity (focus for this lecture)
- Where does growth come from?
	- Take product you already have and go to new customer segments
	- New products
	- How can we extend this product expertise and extend it?
- The Product-Centric Approach
	- The goal of the firm is to maximize shareholder value
	- Maximum profits through volume and cost reductions
	- Key performance indicators such as market share
	- Growth through **extending** the product
	- Product-oriented organizational structure
		- Product manager per product, scientist per-product, etc.
	- The competitive advantage: **product expertise**
	- This was how businesses used to run for a very long time

# Cracks in the Product-Centric Approach
- Product-centricity isn't doomed for failure
- Technology-enabled product development --> **commoditization**
	- Product lifecycles are super tight
	- In a product centric approach, there is a desire for monopolies but if lifecycles are tight this is going away
- Technology-enabled information flow --> **smart customers**
	- Much more informed and demanding
	- Customers are aware of options to them
- Technology-enabled delivery --> **retail saturation**
	- Items are available to you right away due to internet
	- Globalization allows customers to find products and services other areas
	- Deruglation has removed monopolies
- Customers are far more demanding now
	- Customers want *end to end solutions* which might require bundling
	- IBM moved from product-centric to solution advising, they are now telling customers in how to architect new solutions
		- A commoditization-proof approach
- Information systems enable **customer-level tracking**
	- Ford had no idea how his customer base was set-up

# Data-Driven Business Models
- Harrah's (casino)
	- Competitors had much more resources
	- Developed a loyalty program that pulled a large amount of meta data about their customers (which games, which meals, which rooms, etc.)
		- When will their customers walk away
- Tesco (grocery)
	- Developed a loyalty program
	- Which households buy all their meals at Tesco vs which households only buy a subset? Which subset are they missing?
		- Which kind of coupons to send to which customers

# Three Cheers for Direct Marketing
- Direct marketing is normally perceived really poorly
- The individual customer is the unit of analysis
- Know who their customers are and what they buy
- Aim to determine marketing concepts
- Been around since 1967
- Constantly determine (and leverage) indivual customer lifetime value

# Which Firms Are Customer Centric?
All of these are not examples of customer centricity
- Walmart
	- Doesn't know a lot about any one customer is going to buy
	- They **do** know aggregate level information
	- Really more of operational excellence
- Apple
	- Don't spend a lot of time on segmentation
	- Focus on product excellence
- Starbucks
	- Local-level is very customer-centric
	- They do do recommendations on the really close customers
	- At a national level, they aren't that customer-centric
		- If I go to a random starbucks, they know nothing about me
- Nordstrom
	- They don't know the future value of a customer so they treat **every customer** really well

# What is customer centricity?

> **Customer Centricity** is a strategy that aligns a company's development/delivery of its products/services around the current and future needs of a select set of customers in order to maximize their long-term financial value to the firm

- Requires the company to be willing and able to change its organizational design to incentivize long term value for their customers
- A pharmaceutical company changed their compensation program to be forward looking as opposed to reverse looking and it was demonstrably successful
- Customer centricy requires you to look ahead, realize who the valuable customers will be and invest in them

# Living in a customer-centric world
- What's the overarching objective of the customer-centric enterprise?
	- Still maximizing shareholder value.
	- The money making thing is abstract from the goal
- Celebrate **customer heterogeneity** distinguish the profitable customers from the less profitable ones
	- All customers are very different
	- These divergences can be a very good thing, allows good segementation
- Focus on future profitability (customer lifetime value) rather than past profits
- Key tactics that should be primary for these focuses:
  1. Acquisition
  2. Retention
  3. Development (e.g. upselling)
- Customer-centric organizational structure
	- Procter and Gamble
		- customer is the retailer (Walmart, CVS, etc.)
		- My black is beautiful campaign
			- Many different P&G brands advertised together
			- Positioning themselves as a **trusted** advisor
			- CoverGirl Queen is an African American line of products that people would find valuable
- The competitive advantage - "relationship expertise" with respect to focal customers
- Customer relationship data is very difficult, if not impossible, to commoditize
- Product-centric focus requires divergent thinking (how do we take product x to a new market, new utility), customer-centric focus requires convergent thinking (what can we bring to customer x to provide more valuable)

# More Reflections on Customer Centricity
- This **does not** mean firing your least valuable customers
	- This could cause fragility on a reliance of one customer

> Customer centricity does **not** suggest that *non-focal* customers should be ignored or *fired*; to the contrary, it is important to have a healthy proportion of such customers to add a high degree of stability and robustness to the overall customer base. (Think of them like cash in an investment portfolio)

This leads to:

> Taking the idea further, there is a **paradox of customer centricity**: the more that a firm tightents its central focus on a select group of customers, the more it needs its *non-focal* customers to stablize the overall mix.

	- Other pharmaceutical companies have declared one of these cohorts as a customer
- What are the major barriers to become customer-centricity?
- What resources can you utilize to overcome these barriers?
- Thoughts about what competitors are doing in the area?
