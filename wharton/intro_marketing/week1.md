# Strategic Marketing
- Market-Driven Principles
	- Know your Markets
		- What your customers want
		- What your competitors are up to
		- Market research
	- Customers have the final say
		- Customers are going to choose what they want
		- Assumption is that customers do rigorous decision making that chunk a product into categories
			- Operational categories
				- Cost
			- Features (style, attribtues)
			- Meet needs of customers
	- Commit to being first in the markets you serve
		- In the 3 categories listed above, deliver on one whole-heartedly, be appropriate on the other two
	- Deliver total quality to guarantee customer satisfaction
- Value map (linear equation of relative perceived benefits to relative costs to customer) 
- Three bundles
	1. Operational excellence
	2. Performance superiority
	3. Customer intimacy
- For the three attributes, come up with attributes  that make items more or less valuable, then come up with what you think the customers would perceive as fair value for these dimensions
	- Then, take these dimensions and plot where you are relative to your competitors
	- Long-term you should be the best at one and good enough on the other two

# Segmentation and Targeting

- STP Framework
	- **S**egmentation
		- Identify variables that allow one to segment the market

# Brand Positioning
- What is a brand?
	- Formally... A proprietary trademark for a specific product or service
	- A contract from the company to its customer; a promise of specific benefits, quality and value. A relationship
	- A brand is what your customer thinks of you and what he/she tells others about you
- Want to position your product to meet your target segment
- Positioning statements
	- Apple computers offers... the best personal computing experiences to students, educators, creative professionals and consumers around the world through its innonvative hardware, software and Internet offerins
		- Three pieces:
			- Target segment - Students, educators, creative professionals
			- Point of Difference - it's innovative. State of the Art
			- Frame of Reference - other personal computers
	- IBM... for business who need computers
- three points of positioning statements
	- Target market (for whom)
	- Point of difference (reason to buy)
		- Strong, favorable, unique brand associations
		- Must be sustainable
		- Performance attribtues, design, etc.
		- Should be desirable to customer and something you can deliver on
	- Points of parity (frame of reference)
- Positioning is implemented through all elements of the marketing mix (see 4 P's above)
- Position must be defensible
- Positioning does not mean you are everything to everyone. You must be specific and reduced
- The role of positioning influences both product development **and** messaging
- Point of Partiy
	- Associations that are not unique to the brand; they are shared with other brands
	- Ex: grocery store must have certain products (e.g., milk, eggs)
	- Associations designed to negate competitors' point of difference
	- Ex all toothpaste prevents cavities

# Brand Mantra: The Elevator Speech

- Way you define a brand in 30 seconds
	- Easy to understand, hard to get to it

	- Core brand values

			- Communicate
			- Simplify
			- Inspire
		- Three core constructs
			- Brand function that describes products or services
			- The descriptive modifier that clarifies it's function
			- The emotional modifier provides another qualifier - how exactly does the brand provide benefits, and in what way?
		- Used internally to guide decisions - what the brand does and does not do
