# Online / Offline Competition
- Why offline is still important
	- 90% of all purchases are still performed offline
	- Why is this?
		- Delivery times
		- Uncertainty of the "fit and feel"
		- Cost of returns (time and money)
- Do brick and mortar shops influence online sales? (ie; does a bookstore moving into a zip code reduce amazon's aggregate sales?)
	- Yes, they do, but only for popular products (like harry potter)
	- This leads to the concept of *The Long Tail*

# Friction
- Search friction
	- 1987 rugby world cup... where do I buy a TV? Which store will have the best price and assortment?
	- When you find the price, you have to make a decision, do you buy this price? Or do you buy it now?
	- In 2013, you can find all the prices quickly.
- Geographic friction
	- NY vs. Iowa City
	- Amount of services in NY is significantly better than in Iowa City

# The Long Tail

![Long Tail Product](http://www.thelongtail.com/conceptual.jpg)

- Books
	- Say there are 5 million books
	- Say harry potter is the highest popularity for book
	- The *head* of the curve is normally brick and mortar and the tail is internet
- Background
	- We lived in a world of **hits** or **blockbusters**
	- Hypotheses
		- The Long Tail exists because the economics of storage and distribution have changed; this is the **supply side**
		- The Long Tail is itself endogenous (**demand side**) as there are more ways for us to discover variety
- Old-New Economics
	- Pareto principle
		- This changes with The Long Tail since the tail can account for a large amount of purchases
